What works: The program accurately detects all of the specified identifiers. 


What doesn't work:
     	     To our Knowledge, nothing isn't working other than an issue with '&'
	     All unrecognized characters are caught, but for whatever reason if there is a space after a '&', it breaks.
	     Additionally, our .lst file isn't in the format you specified because it was the last thing we did and didn't realize this until right before.
