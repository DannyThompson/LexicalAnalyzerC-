What works: The program accurately detects all of the specified identifiers. 


What doesn't work:
     	     To our Knowledge, nothing isn't working.
	     The only possible complaint is the fact that we read in the file all at once, thus making it harder for us to 		know the specific lexemes on each "line".
	     Therefore, we do not display the "line" of lexemes in the .lst file.
